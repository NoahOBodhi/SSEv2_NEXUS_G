## üìñ What is Spaceship Earth v2.0?

**Spaceship Earth v2.0** is a comprehensive implementation guide for transforming humanity from passive passengers to empowered crew members. Building on Buckminster Fuller's abundance principles, this framework demonstrates how modern technology (AI, blockchain, cybersecurity, data science) can manifest planetary-scale coordination and resource optimization.

### Core Principles:
- **Abundance mindset:** Scarcity is a design flaw, not natural law
- **Crew consciousness:** Everyone is responsible crew, not passenger
- **Synergy principle:** 1+1>2 when capabilities properly combined
- **Technology serves consciousness:** AI amplifies human capability
- **Regeneration over extraction:** Systems that enhance rather than degrade

### Contents:
- **18 Chapters** across 6 major parts
